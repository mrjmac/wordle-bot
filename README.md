Simple bot that keeps track of how people on a discord server do in wordle.

Just type "Wordle scoreboard" after you post your results to see how many attempts it took people. To remove an inactive player(s) do "Wordle remove aaa bbb ccc ddd eee" and 
replace aaa, bbb, ccc, ddd, and eee with the usernames of who you want to remove.
